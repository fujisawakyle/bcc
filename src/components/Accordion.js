            Yes and no. This is the closest we're getting to the idea of a wedding, to celebrate our shared love for one another, but we're not calling it a wedding because we're not following any of the traditions.

            Then, at 11:00 (ON THE DOT), we are going to have a brief observance that will help you all understand what we are celebrating and what we are committing to. This ceremony-type deal will also integrate some singing and music. The important part is that you are all there to witness us make our commitment public.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After our lil ceremony, we will have a big satisfying lunch and some delicious cake.

            There is one really specific gift we want you to give us: You arrive at 10:30am and you stay and dance and laugh and have fun until the party is over at 4pm. You want to give us a gift? Stay. Hang out. Take pictures with us. Dance with us. LETâ€™S BE MERRY.

            Neither of us drink, each for our own personal reasons. We believe that energy flows where attention goes. Thus, we will not be serving alcohol, and there will be no bar.

            If you feel inclined to drink, we ask that you do so off of the property.
